👋 About Me
Hi there! I'm Shivraj Shere, a Mechanical Engineer with a Master’s in Robotics and Autonomous Systems from the University of Sussex. I specialize in mechanical design, robotic systems, and electro-mechanical product development. My work bridges mechanical innovation with automation, smart sensors, and medical robotics — turning complex challenges into elegant solutions.

🔧 Currently, I work as a Technical Engineer at IVY TECH Ltd. (UK), where I lead R&D and project management for cutting-edge applications like IoT-based 3D concrete printing and agricultural predictive maintenance systems. My experience spans product lifecycle management, CAD/FEA simulation, and hands-on prototyping.

💡 I'm particularly passionate about:

Designing robust mechanical systems

Developing sensor-integrated platforms for real-world impact

Exploring innovations in medical and industrial robotics

📚 My background includes:

Publishing research on tactile sensing and robotics automation

Designing a surveillance robot with image processing for remote control

Leading cross-functional teams to deliver projects under budget and ahead of schedule

⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools:

CAD/CAE: SolidWorks, Siemens NX, AutoCAD, Inventor

Simulation: ANSYS, Autodesk CFD, SolidWorks Simulation

Robotics: Mobile & Medical Robotics, Sensor Integration (IoT/Fiber Optics)

Manufacturing: Rapid prototyping, DfM, Injection Moulding, Additive Manufacturing

📌 Fun fact: I’m a member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) and working toward my Chartered Engineer (CEng) certification.
